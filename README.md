 General information about the study
In recent years, people are more curious about vegan and vegetarian diets. With the
increase of vegan nutrition, it is easier to find vegan products in the markets. And the variety
of vegan products is increasing day by day. However the biggest problem faced by vegans or
vegetarians is that they need an adequate intake of protein, vitamin, minerals such as calcium,
iron, and B12. Unconscious nutrition in a vegan diet can lead to many health problems. Not
all vegan store-bought products are healthy and most times the packages can be misleading
about the product’s content. For these reasons, choosing healthy and vegan products can be
challenging.
The aim of this project is to provide a guide where consumers can reach the nutritional
contents they need. We decided to develop a mobile application to help people having these
difficulties. There are food categories in this app such as vegetables, legumes, grains,
packaged goods and beverages. Foods will be listed according to the category the user
chooses, and by searching a product, the user will be able to check the product’s content of
the amount of protein, sugar, fat, salt in that product and so, they can make healthy choices.
This easy to use app will fill an important void in the app markets.
